Did Jesus know Who He was and what He was supposed to do or did He have to figure it out?

John 7:13-18

At this the Pharisees said to Him, "You are testifying on Your own behalf; Your testimony is not valid."
Jesus replied, "It is true that I am testifying on My own behalf, but My testimony is still valid, because I know where I come from and where I am going."
"But you do not know where I come from or where I am going. You judge by human standards; I judge no one."
"But if I judge, my judgment will be sound, because I am not alone: the One Who sent me is with me."
"And in your Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid."
"I may be testifying on My own behalf, but the Father Who sent me is My witness too."

After Jesus ascended into Heaven, the Holy Spirit was sent to advocate as a witness. 

“When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me.

By sending another witness in His place, that answers the question of whether or not Jesus needed no witness on Earth because He was part of God or if that applies to others too. Or at least it means that the Holy Spirit is our second witness to God. For that reason we need not fear ever being out of earshot of God.
