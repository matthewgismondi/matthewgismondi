Can we be hidden away from God?

John 8:25-30

“Who are You?” they asked.
“Just what I have been telling you from the beginning,” Jesus replied.
“I have much to say in judgment of you. But He who sent me is trustworthy, and what I have heard from Him I tell the world.”
They did not understand that He was telling them about His Father.
So Jesus said, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He and that I do nothing on My own but speak just what the Father has taught Me."
"The one who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do what pleases Him.”
Even as He spoke, many believed in Him.

"Lifted up" 
STRONGS NT 5312: ὑψόω

The crowd spoke up, “We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever, so how can you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’? Who is this ‘Son of Man’?”
Then Jesus told them, “You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going."
